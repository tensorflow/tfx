# Requests for Comment (RFCs)

TFX is an open-source project and we strongly encourage active participation
by the ML community in helping to shape TFX to meet or exceed their needs. An
important component of that effort is the RFC process.  Please see the
[TensorFlow Request for Comments (TF-RFC)](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/governance/TF-RFCs.md)
process page for information on how community members can contribute.

Below are the current and past TFX RFCs and their current status.
