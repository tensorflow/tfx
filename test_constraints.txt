# test_constraints.txt
# This file specifies the constraints for the test environment of tfx.
# Unlike library dependency which aims to specify the widest version range
# possible, it is okay to specify exact version here.
#
# constraints.txt file is similar to requirements.txt except it does not tell
# to really "install" the specified target; it only specifies the version
# constraint if it is installed either directly or transitively by the
# dependencies.
