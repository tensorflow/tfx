  The StatisticsGen component generates features statistics and random samples
  over training data, which can be used for visualization and validation.
  StatisticsGen uses Apache Beam and approximate algorithms to scale to large
  datasets.

  ## Example
  ```
    # Computes statistics over data for visualization and example validation.
    statistics_gen = StatisticsGen(examples=example_gen.outputs['examples'])
  ```

  Component `outputs` contains:
   - `statistics`: Channel of type `standard_artifacts.ExampleStatistics` for
                   statistics of each split provided in the input examples.

  Please see [the StatisticsGen
  guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/statsgen) for more details.
