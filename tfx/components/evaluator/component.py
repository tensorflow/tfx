class Evaluator(base_component.BaseComponent):
  """A TFX component to evaluate models trained by a TFX Trainer component.

  The Evaluator component performs model evaluations in the TFX pipeline and
  the resultant metrics can be viewed in a Jupyter notebook.  It uses the
  input examples generated from the
  [ExampleGen](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/examplegen)
  component to evaluate the models.

  Specifically, it can provide:
    - metrics computed on entire training and eval dataset
    - tracking metrics over time
    - model quality performance on different feature slices

  ## Exporting the EvalSavedModel in Trainer

  In order to setup Evaluator in a TFX pipeline, an EvalSavedModel needs to be
  exported during training, which is a special SavedModel containing
  annotations for the metrics, features, labels, and so on in your model.
  Evaluator uses this EvalSavedModel to compute metrics.

  As part of this, the Trainer component creates eval_input_receiver_fn,
  analogous to the serving_input_receiver_fn, which will extract the features
  and labels from the input data. As with serving_input_receiver_fn, there are
  utility functions to help with this.

  Please see https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/model_analysis for more details.

  ## Example
  ```
    # Uses TFMA to compute a evaluation statistics over features of a model.
    model_analyzer = Evaluator(
        examples=example_gen.outputs['examples'],
        model=trainer.outputs['model'])
