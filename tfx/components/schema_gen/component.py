  """A TFX SchemaGen component to generate a schema from the training data.

  The SchemaGen component uses [TensorFlow Data
  Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/api_docs/python/tfdv)
  to generate a schema from input statistics. The following TFX libraries use
  the schema:
    - TensorFlow Data Validation
    - TensorFlow Transform
    - TensorFlow Model Analysis

  In a typical TFX pipeline, the SchemaGen component generates a schema which is
  is consumed by the other pipeline components.

  ## Example
  ```
    # Generates schema based on statistics files.
    infer_schema = SchemaGen(statistics=statistics_gen.outputs['statistics'])
  ```

  Component `outputs` contains:
   - `schema`: Channel of type `standard_artifacts.Schema` for schema result.

  See [the SchemaGen guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/schemagen)
  for more details.
