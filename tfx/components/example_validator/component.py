  """A TFX component to validate input examples.

  The ExampleValidator component uses [Tensorflow Data
  Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation) to
  validate the statistics of some splits on input examples against a schema.

  The ExampleValidator component identifies anomalies in training and serving
  data. The component can be configured to detect different classes of anomalies
  in the data. It can:
    - perform validity checks by comparing data statistics against a schema that
      codifies expectations of the user.
    - detect data drift by looking at a series of data.
    - detect changes in dataset-wide data (i.e., num_examples) across spans or
      versions.

  Schema Based Example Validation
  The ExampleValidator component identifies any anomalies in the example data by
  comparing data statistics computed by the StatisticsGen component against a
  schema. The schema codifies properties which the input data is expected to
  satisfy, and is provided and maintained by the user.

  Please see https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation for more details.

  ## Example
  ```
  # Performs anomaly detection based on statistics and data schema.
  validate_stats = ExampleValidator(
      statistics=statistics_gen.outputs['statistics'],
      schema=infer_schema.outputs['schema'])
  ```
