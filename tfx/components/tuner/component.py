        as the schema of training and eval data. This is used when raw examples
        are provided.
      transform_graph: An optional Channel of type
        `standard_artifacts.TransformGraph`, serving as the input transform
        graph if present. This is used when transformed examples are provided.
      module_file: A path to python module file containing UDF tuner definition.
        The module_file must implement a function named `tuner_fn` at its top
        level. The function must have the following signature.
            def tuner_fn(fn_args: FnArgs) -> TunerFnResult:
        Exactly one of 'module_file' or 'tuner_fn' must be supplied.
      tuner_fn:  A python path to UDF model definition function. See
        'module_file' for the required signature of the UDF. Exactly one of
        'module_file' or 'tuner_fn' must be supplied.
      train_args: A trainer_pb2.TrainArgs instance, containing args used for
        training. Currently only splits and num_steps are available. Default
        behavior (when splits is empty) is train on `train` split.
      eval_args: A trainer_pb2.EvalArgs instance, containing args used for eval.
        Currently only splits and num_steps are available. Default behavior
        (when splits is empty) is evaluate on `eval` split.
      tune_args: A tuner_pb2.TuneArgs instance, containing args used for tuning.
        Currently only num_parallel_trials is available.
      custom_config: A dict which contains addtional training job parameters
        that will be passed into user module.
      best_hyperparameters: Optional Channel of type
        `standard_artifacts.HyperParameters` for result of the best hparams.
      instance_name: Optional unique instance name. Necessary if multiple Tuner
        components are declared in the same pipeline.
