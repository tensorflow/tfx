  """TFX Pusher executor to push the new TF model to a filesystem target.

  The Pusher component is used to deploy a validated model to a filesystem
  target or serving environment using tf.serving.  Pusher depends on the outputs
  of ModelValidator to determine if a model is ready to push. A model is
  considered to be safe to push only if ModelValidator has marked it as BLESSED.
  A push action delivers the model exports produced by Trainer to the
  destination defined in the ``push_destination`` of the component config.

  To include Pusher in a TFX pipeline, configure your pipeline similar to
  https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/blob/master/tfx/examples/chicago_taxi_pipeline/taxi_pipeline_simple.py#L104.

  For more details on tf.serving itself, please refer to
  https://tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/pusher.  For a tutuorial on TF Serving,
  please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving.
