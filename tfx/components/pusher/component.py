  The `Pusher` component can be used to push an validated SavedModel from output
  of `Trainer` to tensorflow Serving (tf.serving). If the model is not blessed
  by `ModelValidator`, no push will happen.

  Args:
    model_export: A Channel of 'ModelExportPath' type, usually produced by
      Trainer component.
    model_blessing: A Channel of 'ModelBlessingPath' type, usually produced by
      ModelValidator component.
    push_destination: A pusher_py2.PushDestinationLabel instance, providing
      info for tensorflow serving to load models.
    name: Optional unique name. Necessary if multiple Pusher components are
      declared in the same pipeline.
    outputs: Optional dict from name to output channel.
  Attributes:
    outputs: A ComponentOutputs including following keys:
      - model_push: A channel of 'ModelPushPath' with result of push.
