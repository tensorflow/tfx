# TODO(b/133845381): Investigate other ways to keep push destination converged.
class Pusher(base_component.BaseComponent):
  """A TFX component to push validated TensorFlow models to a model serving platform.

  The `Pusher` component can be used to push an validated SavedModel from output
  of the [Trainer component](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/trainer) to
  [TensorFlow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving).  The Pusher
  will check the validation results from the [Evaluator
  component](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/evaluator) and [InfraValidator
  component](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/infra_validator)
  before deploying the model.  If the model has not been blessed, then the model
  will not be pushed.

  *Note:* The executor for this component can be overriden to enable the model
  to be pushed to other serving platforms than tf.serving.  The [Cloud AI
  Platform custom
  executor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx/tree/master/tfx/extensions/google_cloud_ai_platform/pusher)
  provides an example how to implement this.

  ## Example
  ```
    # Checks whether the model passed the validation steps and pushes the model
    # to a file destination if check passed.
    pusher = Pusher(
        model=trainer.outputs['model'],
        model_blessing=evaluator.outputs['blessing'],
        push_destination=proto.PushDestination(
            filesystem=proto.PushDestination.Filesystem(
                base_directory=serving_model_dir)))
  ```

  Component `outputs` contains:
   - `pushed_model`: Channel of type `standard_artifacts.PushedModel` with
                     result of push.

  See [the Pusher guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/pusher) for more
  details.
