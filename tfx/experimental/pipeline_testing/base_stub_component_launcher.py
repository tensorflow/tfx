    For KFP, stub launcher class inheriting this class is defined in
    tfx.experimental.templates.taxi.launcher.stub_component_launcher.py.

    These classes then can be used to launch stub executors in the pipeline.

    For example,

    Args:
      test_data_dir: The directory where pipeline outputs are recorded
        (pipeline_recorder.py).
      test_component_ids: List of ids of components that are to be tested. In
        other words, executors of components other than those specified by this
