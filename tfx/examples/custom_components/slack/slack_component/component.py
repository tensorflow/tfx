  """Custom TFX Slack Component.

  This custom component serves as a bridge between TFX pipeline and human model
  reviewers to enable review-and-push workflow in model development cycle. It
  utilizes Slack API to send message to user-defined Slack channel with model
  URI info and wait for go / no-go decision from the same Slack channel:
    * To approve the model, a user need to reply the thread sent out by the bot
      started by SlackComponent with 'lgtm' or 'approve'.
    * To reject the model, a user need to reply the thread sent out by the bot
      started by SlackComponent with 'decline' or 'reject'.

  If the model is approved, an artifact will be created in ML metadata. It will
  be materialized as a file named 'BLESSED' in the directory specified by the
  URI of 'slack_blessing' artifact.
  If the model is rejected, an artifact will be created in ML metadata. It will
  be materialized as a file named 'NOT_BLESSED' in the directory specified by
  the URI of 'slack_blessing' channel.
  If no message indicating approve or reject was is received within given within
  timeout_sec, component will error out. This ensures that model will not be
  pushed and the validation is still retry-able.

  The output artifact might contain the following custom properties:
    - blessed: integer value indicating whether the model is blessed
    - slack_decision_maker: the user id that made the decision.
    - slack_decision_message: the message of the decision
    - slack_decision_channel: the slack channel the decision is made on
    - slack_decision_thread: the slack thread the decision is made on
