# Tuner Component

A Prototype for hyperparameter tuning component. Interface might change when
moving it as an official TFX component.

The iris e2e example is similar to examples/iris except it includes the Tuner
for hyperparameter tuning and Trainer component takes the tuning results as
input for its hyperparameter setting.
