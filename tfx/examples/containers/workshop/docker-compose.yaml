    # Note: You should create the `airflow` directory BEFORE running `docker-compose up`, and
    #       export a WSHOME shell variable to point to the directory where you created the airflow
    #       directory.  WSHOME ("workshop home") should be set to the absolute path of the directory
    #       on your host system where you're running the workshop.  The airflow directory should be
    #       under that.  In the container, it will be mounted as /root/airflow.  The default
    #       Airflow directory inside the container (where you will actually run Airflow) is under
    #       your home directory, and you're running in the container as root, so the directory will
    #       be /root/airflow
    #
    #       For convenience, you can automate the process with:
    #       https://github.com/tensorflow/workshops/blob/master/tfx_airflow/host_start.sh
    - "$WSHOME/airflow:/root/airflow"
