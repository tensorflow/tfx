"""Setuptools ResolveDeps command.

Resolve full transitive dependency from dependency constraints in setup.py. If
resolution was successful it prints the list of decided version. If resolution
fails it dies with error, trying its best to output the failure reason.

Currently dependency resolution is backed by Poetry's Mixology (PubGrub
algorithm), which is different from pip's resolver (based on ResolveLib).

Args:
  --tf-version: Directives for selecting tensorflow version. Can be one of
      RELEASED_TF, RELEASED_TF_2, or PRERELEASED_TF_2.

Usage:
  python setup.py resolve_deps
  python setup.py resolve_deps --tf-version RELEASED_TF_2
