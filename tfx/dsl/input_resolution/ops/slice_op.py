  """Slice operator similar to python slice.

  For those who are not familiar with python slicing, python list can have a
  sliced index in the form of `values[start:stop]` to select the subitems of the
  list. `start` or `stop` can be omitted (e.g. `values[:3]`, `values[1:]`, or
  even `values[:]`), have negative values (e.g. `values[-2:]` selects the last 2
  elements).

  There is also a `step` argument that can be specified as part of the slice,
  which controls the step size, or the stride, of the slice range, but this is
  omitted in the Slice operator for brevity.

  Usage:

  ```python
  @resolver_function
  def head(artifacts, n: int):
    return Slice(artifacts, stop=n, min_count=n)
  ```

  Attributes:
    start: A start index (inclusive) of the slice range. Can be negative (index
      from the backward), or omitted (range from the beginning).
    stop: A stop index (exclusive) of the slice range. Can be negative (index
      from the backward), or omitted (range to the end).
    min_count: If specified, the operator ensures the sliced range contains at
      least this number of items. If it isn't, it raises InsufficientInputError,
      which in synchronous pipeline treated as an error, and in asynchronous
      pipeline treated as an idle thus wait until min_count is met.

    # Note: `values[None:3]` is equivalent to `values[:3]`, so we can safely
    # use `None` value of the operator property.
