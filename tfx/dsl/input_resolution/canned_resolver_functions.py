  """Returns artifacts with spans in a rolling range.

  A rolling range covers the latest (largest) spans. It's calculated in the
  following order:

  1. Sort the artifacts by span in ascending order.
  2. Remove the last skip_num_recent_spans number of spans (removing the largest
     spans).
  3. Select the last num_spans number of spans (the remaining largest spans).
  4. Exclude the spans of exclude_span_numbers. Note that this exclusion
     happens last for backward compatibility. This can result in having less
     than num_spans spans, meaning the consumer component would be skipped due
     to lack of inputs. To avoid this, you would have to increase min_spans.

  Pythonically, this range is equivalent to:
  sorted_spans[:-skip_num_recent_spans][-num_spans:]

  This resolver function is based on the span-version semantics, which only
  considers the latest version of each span. If you want to keep all versions,
  then set keep_all_versions=True. Input artifacts must have both "span" int
  property and "version" int property.

  Please note that the spans in exclude_span_numbers are excluded AFTER getting
  the latest spans.

  If there are less than min_spans unique spans present in the resolved
  artifacts, then the component execution will be skipped.

        keep_all_versions=True,
        exclude_span_numbers=[7],
        min_spans=1)

    spans 1 and 2 are removed because they are < start_span_number=3. The
    sorted unique spans are [3, 7, 8].

    span 8 is removed because skip_num_recent_spans=1, leaving spans [3, 7].

    Although num_spans=5, only two unique span numbers are availble, 3 and 7,
    so both spans [3, 7] are kept.

    Because keep_all_versions=True, both artifacts with span=3 are kept.

    Because exclude_span_numbers=[7], the artifact with span=7 will not be
    kept, even though it is in the range.

    The artifacts that will be returned are:
      spans = [3, 3]
      versions = [1, 0]

    Note min_spans=1, so a SkipSignal will not be present in the compiled IR.

  Args:
    artifacts: The artifacts to filter.
    start_span_number: The smallest span number to keep, inclusive. Defaults to
      0.
    num_spans: The length of the range. If num_spans <= 0, then num_spans is set
      to the total number of unique spans.
    skip_num_recent_spans: Number of most recently available (largest) spans to

    keep_all_versions: If true, all artifacts with spans in the range are kept.
      If false then if multiple artifacts have the same span, only the span with

  """Returns artifacts with spans in a sequential rolling range.

  Sequential rolling range is a sliding window on the oldest consecutive spans.

  The consecutive spans must be in the range:
  [start_span_number, max_span - skip_num_recent_spans], where max_span is the
  maximum span present in the artifacts. This range is modified to account for
  exclude_span_numbers, for details see the ConsecutiveSpans ResolverOp
  implementation.

  The window size is num_spans and has a stride of 1. If the spans are not
  consecutive, then the sequential rolling range waits for the missing span to
  arrive.

  This resolver function is based on the span-version semantics, which only
  considers the latest version of each span. If you want to keep all versions,
  then set keep_all_versions=True. Input artifacts must have both "span" int
  property and "version" int property.

  Corresponds to SequentialRollingRange in TFX.

  Example usage:

    Consider 5 artifacts [A, B, C, D, E] with spans = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7].

        start_span_number=1,

        keep_all_versions=False,
        exclude_span_numbers=[])

    The artifacts will be returned with a sliding window of size num_spans=3 and
    stride 1 applied:

    [[A, B, C], [B, C, D]]

    However, if nums_spans=5, there are only 4 consecutive spans to consider, so
    [], no artifacts, will be returned.

  Since sequential_rolling_range returns multiple windows, it must be used
  together with ForEach. For example:

    with ForEach(sequential_rolling_range(
        all_examples, num_spans=10)) as examples_window:
      trainer = Trainer(examples=examples_window)

  Args:

      configured wrong (so that it is smaller than the first span number), we
      will wait indefinitely until the missing spans between start_span_number
      and the first span number to be appeared.
    num_spans: The length of the range. If num_spans <= 0, then num_spans is set
      to the total number of artifacts with consecutive spans in the range. Note
      that this is also the size of the sliding window of the sequential rolling
      range.
    skip_num_recent_spans: Number of most recently available (largest) spans to
      skip. Defaults to 0.
    keep_all_versions: If true, all artifacts with spans in the range are kept.
      If false then if multiple artifacts have the same span, only the span with
