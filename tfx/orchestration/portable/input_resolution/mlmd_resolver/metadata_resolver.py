  """Metadata resolver for reasoning about metadata information.

  Metadata resolver composes and sends queries to get a lineage graph from
  metadata store. The lineage graph is a snapshot view of the ML pipeline's
  metadata, containing all information needed to answer quetions about the
  lineage of nodes of interest.
  Based on the lineage graph, metadata resolver provides a set of util functions
  that help users reason about metadata information by post-processing the
  graph.
  It can be considered as a wrapper layer built on top of metadata store's graph
  tracing APIs.

  Example:

  # `store` is a metadata store that has been initialized.
  resolver = MetadataResolver(store)
  # Call functions defined in MetadataResolver. For example:
  artifact_ids = [model.id]
  downstream_artifacts_dict = get_downstream_artifacts_by_artifact_ids(
      artifact_ids, max_num_hops = 2

    For each artifact matched by a given `artifact_id`, treat it as a starting
    artifact and get artifacts that are connected to them within `max_num_hops`
    via a path in the upstream direction like:
    artifact_i -> OUTPUT_event -> execution_j -> INPUT_event -> artifact_k.

    A hop is defined as a jump to the next node following the path of node
    -> event -> next_node.
    For example, in the lineage graph artifact_1 -> event -> execution_1
    -> event -> artifact_2:
    artifact_2 is 2 hops away from artifact_1, and execution_1 is 1 hop away
    from artifact_1.

    Args:
        artifact_ids: ids of starting artifacts. At most 100 ids are supported.
          Returns empty result if `artifact_ids` is empty.
        max_num_hops: maximum number of hops performed for upstream tracing.
          `max_num_hops` cannot exceed 100 nor be negative.
        filter_query: a query string filtering upstream artifacts by their own
          attributes or the attributes of immediate neighbors. Please refer to
          go/mlmd-filter-query-guide for more detailed guidance. Note: if
          `filter_query` is specified and `max_num_hops` is 0, it's equivalent
          to getting filtered artifacts by artifact ids with `get_artifacts()`.
        event_filter: an optional callable object for filtering events in the
          paths towards the upstream artifacts. Only an event with
          `event_filter(event)` evaluated to True will be considered as valid
          and kept in the path.
