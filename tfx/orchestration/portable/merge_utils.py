  Before an execution begins, the orchestrator will generate expected output
  artifacts based on the pipeline IR. These output artifacts are registered in
  MLMD as pending output artifacts, and are what is passed to the pipeline node
  in the ExecutionInvocation.

  Following the execution, the node returns an ExecutorOutput to the
  orchestrator, which can contain output artifacts for the execution that the
  node wants the orchestrator to update. A common use case for this is that the
  node populates properties on the output artifacts during execution.

  This function handles the merging logic to reconcile the pre-registered copy
  of the output artifacts with the final set provided back by the pipeline node.

      start of the execution, which were generated based on the pipeline IR.
