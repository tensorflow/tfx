  The idea of using this context manager is to ensure that the in-memory state
  of an MLMD execution is centrally managed so that it stays in sync with the
  execution in MLMD even when multiple threads in the process may be mutating.

  If execution for given execution id exists in MLMD, it is locked before being
  yielded so that no other thread in the process can make conflicting updates if
  the yielded execution is mutated within the context. Mutated executions are
  also automatically committed to MLMD when exiting the context.

  Args:
    mlmd_handle: A handle to MLMD db.
    execution_id: Id of the execution to yield.
    on_commit: An optional callback function which is invoked post successful
      MLMD execution commit operation. This won't be invoked if execution is not
      mutated within the context and hence MLMD commit is not needed. The
      callback is passed copies of the pre-commit and post-commit executions.

  Yields:
    If execution with given id exists in MLMD, the execution is yielded under
    an exclusive lock context.

  Raises:
    RuntimeError: If execution id is changed within the context.
