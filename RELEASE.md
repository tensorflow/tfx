# Current version (not yet released; still in development)

## Major Features and Improvements
*   Adds support for Google Cloud ML Engine Training and Serving as extension.

*   Supported pre-split input for ExampleGen components
*   Added ImportExampleGen component for importing tfrecord files with
    TF Example data format
*   Added a generic ExampleGen component to reduce the work of custom ExampleGen
*   Release Python 3 type hints.

## Bug fixes and other changes
*   Declared 'cmle_training_args' on trainer and 'cmle_serving_args' on
    pusher deprecated. User should use the `trainer/pusher` executors in
    tfx.extensions.google_cloud_ai_platform module instead.

*   Update components and code samples to use `tft.TFTransformOutput` (
    introduced in tensorflow_transform 0.8).  This avoids directly accessing the
    DatasetSchema object which may be removed in tensorflow_transform 0.14 or
    0.15.

# Version 0.13.0

## Major Features and Improvements
*   Adds support for Python 3.5
*   Initial version of following orchestration platform supported:
    *   Kubeflow
*   Added TensorFlow Model Analysis Colab example
*   Supported split ratio for ExampleGen components
*   Supported running a single executor independently

## Bug fixes and other changes

*   Fixes issue #43 that prevent new execution in some scenarios
*   Fixes issue #47 that causes ImportError on chicago_taxi execution on dataflow
*   Depends on `apache-beam[gcp]>=2.12,<3`
*   Depends on `tensorflow-data-validation>=0.13.1,<0.14`
*   Depends on `tensorflow-model-analysis>=0.13.2,<0.14`
*   Depends on `tensorflow-transform>=0.13,<0.14`
*   Deprecations:
    *    PipelineDecorator is deprecated. Please construct a pipeline directly from a list of components instead.
*   Increased verbosity of logging to container stdout when running under
    Kubeflow Pipelines.
*   Updated developer tutorial to support Python 3.5+

## Breaking changes
*   Examples code are moved from 'examples' to 'tfx/examples': this ensures that PyPi package contains only one top level python module 'tfx'.

## Things to notice for upgrading
*   Multiprocessing on Mac OS >= 10.13 might crash for Airflow. See
    [AIRFLOW-3326](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3326)
    for details and solution.

# Version 0.12.0

## Major Features and Improvements

*   Adding TFMA Architecture doc
*   TFX User Guide
*   Initial version of the following TFX components:
    *   CSVExampleGen - CSV data ingestion
    *   BigQueryExampleGen - BigQuery data ingestion
    *   StatisticsGen - calculates statistics for the dataset
    *   SchemaGen - examines the dataset and creates a data schema
    *   ExampleValidator - looks for anomalies and missing values in the dataset
    *   Transform - performs feature engineering on the dataset
    *   Trainer - trains the model
    *   Evaluator - performs analysis of the model performance
    *   ModelValidator - helps validate exported models ensuring that they are
        "good enough" to be pushed to production
    *   Pusher - deploys the model to a serving infrastructure, for example the
        TensorFlow Serving Model Server
*   Initial version of following orchestration platform supported:
    *   Apache Airflow
*   Polished examples based on the Chicago Taxi dataset.

## Bug fixes and other changes

*   Cleanup Colabs to remove TF warnings
*   Performance improvement during shuffling of post-transform data.
*   Changing example to move everything to one file in plugins
*   Adding instructions to refer to README when running Chicago Taxi notebooks
