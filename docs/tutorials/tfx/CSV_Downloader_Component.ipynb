Furthermore, one important goal of TFX production ML pipeline is to collect metadata containing information about the pipeline components, their executions, and resulting artifacts. In other words, the purpose of the metadata is to analyze the lineage of pipeline components and debug issues, and the CSV Downloader Component would help the users logging and tracking information about the source of the data and the preprocessing steps that the data have undergone before entering the pipeline. In this section, we declare a new artifact called CSVdoc and develop a custom component -- CSV Downloader -- which stores information about the dataset and downloads the CSV file in the CSVdoc artifact's URI."
