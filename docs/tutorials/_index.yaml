        A great way to learn TensorFlow Extended (TFX) is to learn by doing.
        These tutorials are focused examples of the key parts of TFX. They
        include beginner tutorials to get started, and more advanced tutorials
        for when you really want to dive into more advanced parts of TFX. Most
        of these tutorials run in Google Colab so everything is already set up
        and readyâ€”there's no need to install anything to start learning.
