It accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means a [`Tensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor) or [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor). There are two main groups of API calls that typically form the heart of a preprocessing function:\n",

These add TensorFlow operations to the graph that transforms raw data into transformed data one feature vector at a time.  These will run for every example, during both training and serving.\n",
        "2. **TensorFlow Transform Analyzers:** Any of the analyzers provided by tf.Transform. Analyzers also accept and return tensors, but unlike TensorFlow ops they only run once, during training, and typically make a full pass over the entire training dataset. They create [tensor constants](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/constant), which are added to your graph. For example, `tft.min` computes the minimum of a tensor over the training dataset. tf.Transform provides a fixed set of analyzers, but this will be extended in future versions.\n",

We also created an input function that we could use when we deploy our trained model in a production environment to perform inference.  By using the same code for both training and inference we avoid any issues with data skew.  Along the way we learned about creating an Apache Beam transform to perform the transformation that we needed for cleaning the data. We also saw how to use this transformed data to train a model using either `tf.keras` or `tf.estimator`.  This is just a small piece of what TensorFlow Transform can do!  We encourage you to dive into `tf.Transform` and discover what it can do for you."
