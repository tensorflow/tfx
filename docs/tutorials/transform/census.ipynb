They create [tensor constants](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/constant), which are added to your graph.

        "In this example we used `tf.Transform` to preprocess a dataset of census data, and train a model with the cleaned and transformed data.  We also created an input function that we could use when we deploy our trained model in a production environment to perform inference.  By using the same code for both training and inference we avoid any issues with data skew.  Along the way we learned about creating an Apache Beam transform to perform the transformation that we needed for cleaning the data, and wrapped our data in TensorFlow `FeatureColumns`.  This is just a small piece of what TensorFlow Transform can do!  We encourage you to dive into `tf.Transform` and discover what it can do for you."
