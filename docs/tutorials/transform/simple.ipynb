It accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors, where a tensor means a \u003ca target='_blank' href='https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/Tensor'\u003e\u003ccode\u003eTensor\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca target='_blank' href='https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/SparseTensor'\u003e\u003ccode\u003eSparseTensor\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. There are two main groups of API calls that typically form the heart of a preprocessing function:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **TensorFlow Ops:** Any function that accepts and returns tensors, which usually means TensorFlow ops. These add TensorFlow operations to the graph that transforms raw data into transformed data one feature vector at a time.  These will run for every example, during both training and serving.\n",
        "2. **Tensorflow Transform Analyzers/Mappers:** Any of the analyzers/mappers provided by tf.Transform. These also accept and return tensors, and typically contain a combination of Tensorflow ops and Beam computation, but unlike TensorFlow ops they only run in the Beam pipeline during analysis requiring a full pass over the entire training dataset. The Beam computation runs only once, during training, and typically make a full pass over the entire training dataset. They create tensor constants, which are added to your graph. For example, tft.min computes the minimum of a tensor over the training dataset while tft.scale_by_min_max first computes the min and max of a tensor over the training dataset and then scales the tensor to be within a user-specified range, [output_min, output_max]. tf.Transform provides a fixed set of such analyzers/mappers, but this will be extended in future versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Caution: When you apply your preprocessing function to serving inferences, the constants that were created by analyzers during training do not change.  If your data has trend or seasonality components, plan accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: The `preprocessing_fn` is not directly callable. This means that\n",
